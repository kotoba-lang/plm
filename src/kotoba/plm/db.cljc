  "Domain-facing data facade — a thin delegation over the `Store` protocol
   (kotoba.plm.store). The whole domain (item / cost / thread / mrp /
   production) touches the graph only through these fns, so a connection can
   be a Datomic Local store (dev/test, kotoba.plm.store-datomic) or the
   kotoba-datomic XRPC store (prod) interchangeably.

   The 'db handle' returned by `db` IS the store: queries run against current
   state, so re-read `(db conn)` after each `tx!` rather than holding a snapshot."
